Pixel-Finder
=========

Pixel-Finder is a simple GUI tool used to find pixel color and pixel coordinates based on the cursor location.


Still a work in progress. I plan on making this a multi-tool with an auto-clicker and other functions as well.


For any help using this program you can add me on discord at 6oo53 and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
